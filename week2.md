# *Week2*

 I have Started with the basics concept of a CMS and its purpose. I Understand how Joomla fits into the CMS landscape and what its main features and capabilities are working.

 I tried Set up a local development environment by Installing Joomla on your local using a web server software XAMPP. This allows me to create a local testing environment where I can practice and experiment with Joomla without affecting a live website.

But, at this point there were so many problems, my id was not accepted by joomla login and I tried many times for Xampp as well nothing was working at all. 

I used Digital Ocean for my practical,
it's really usefull to use. I registered with student email and connected to github.

# *Learning Activities & Resources*

I watched so many videos for this issue so that I can resolve that problem. 
I tried to use different sites as well. 
There were some paid offers for some sites, but seems complicated for me. 
It takes so much time to do all this for meeting the requirements of practical. 

At the end, I learned regarding digital ocean and here so many sites available that helps to complete tasks with help of digital ocean having a free trail. I have provided some links from youtube.

# Estimated Hours

I spent alot time on it. 
A whole I spent on joomla and Xampp setting and still that was not working at all. 
Next day, I tried to do with another softwares but that all was not working.
Approximately, spent 72 hours on this work.

# Content Insights
Once Joomla installed, I spent some time navigating through the admin interface. Get the information doe being familiar with the different sections and options available. I just took the note of the main components, modules, templates, and extensions that come with Joomla.

After successful installation, I did access the Joomla administration panel by entering "localhost/your_joomla_directory/administrator" in your web browser. Log in using the administrator provided during the installation.
But all was not working.

I did this with help of digital ocean. Youtube links are available for this content that helps to improve the work.

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights

By learning Joomla and content management systems (CMS), I had gained  several valuable skills and knowledge that can benefit in web development and website management. 

I learnt how to create and publish articles, manage categories and tags, and control user permissions for content editing and publishing.

 With the help of CMS I had got knowledge how to assign tasks, review and approve content, track changes, and streamline the content creation process.

I learnt the use of digital ocean having different sections and some of the videos are teaching form ground level.
As it is my starting point on this, I sorted out so many issues that are impossible by using Joomla or Xampp.
Digital ocean is a good example for hosting ant website.
